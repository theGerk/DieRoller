# DieRoller

An interpreter for a simple language so you can roll dice more easily.

# How to use:

An expression may be:  
* an integer
* a unary operator followed by an expression
* an expression followed by a binary operator followed by a binary operator
* an expression contained within parentheses '``(``' and '``)``'

The unary operators are:
* ``+`` - unary addition (does nothing)
* ``-`` - additive inverse (works as expected)
* ``d`` - rolls a die of specified size

The binary operators are:
* ``+`` - addition (works as expected)
* ``-`` - subtraction (works as expected)
* ``d`` - roll dice


##How the unary and binary ``d`` works.
